## 🧠 About Me

I’m a data engineer working with tools like **Airflow**, **DBT**, and **Snowflake SQL** to orchestrate and manage data pipelines at scale. I love building smart, efficient workflows and solving tough data problems.

When I’m not engineering pipelines, I’m:
- 🐍 Writing complex Python transformations
- 🤖 Exploring AI & machine learning projects
- 🧠 Solving algorithmic challenges on LeetCode in **C++**
- 🧪 Building data science side projects in Python
